# Introducing ATEM Mini Pro
### The compact television studio that lets you create presentation videos and live streams!
Blackmagic Design is a leader in video for the television 
industry, and now you can create your own streaming videos 
with ATEM Mini. Simply connect HDMI cameras, computers 
or even microphones. Then push the buttons on the panel 
to switch video sources just like a professional broadcaster! 
You can even add titles, picture in picture overlays and mix 
audio! Then live stream to Zoom, Skype or YouTube!

#### Create Training and Educational Videos
ATEM Mini’s includes everything you need. All the buttons are 
positioned on the front panel so it’s very easy to learn. There are 4 
HDMI video inputs for connecting cameras and computers, plus a 
USB output that looks like a webcam so you can connect to Zoom 
or Skype. ATEM Software Control for Mac and PC is also included, 
which allows access to more advanced “broadcast” features!

#### Use Professional Video Effects
ATEM Mini is really a professional broadcast switcher used by 
television stations. This means it has professional effects such as a 
DVE for picture in picture effects commonly used for commentating 
over a computer slide show. There are titles for presenter names, 
wipe effects for transitioning between sources and a green screen 
keyer for replacing backgrounds with graphics.

#### Live Stream Training and Conferences
The ATEM Mini Pro model has a built in hardware streaming engine 
for live streaming via its ethernet connection. This means you can 
live stream to YouTube, Facebook and Teams in much better quality 
and with perfectly smooth motion. You can even connect a hard 
disk or flash storage to the USB connection and record your stream 
for upload later!

#### Monitor all Video Inputs!
With so many cameras, computers and effects, things can get busy 
fast! The ATEM Mini Pro model features a “multiview” that lets you 
see all cameras, titles and program, plus streaming and recording 
status all on a single TV or monitor. There are even tally indicators to 
show when a camera is on air! Only ATEM Mini is a true professional 
television studio in a small compact design!
